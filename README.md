- 👋 Hi, I’m @Michael-Roop. 
     Newly registered here on Github, so forgive me for sticking out my neck, straight from the start.

- 👀 I’m interested in 
          - financial services for medium to large corporations
          - administrative-financial services platforms, incl. enterprise security
          - decisionmaking support systems
                    
     I have spent two decades working in bluechip companies' financial, manufacturing, and new market entry/ventures
     areas. Experience and skills in finance, fund raising, business development - in mature industries.
     Lifelong dream to develop fintech businesses, service platforms and similar things.
     
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning programming, Java, C++ etc. on my own, but also through online classes, as my technical skills  
     are with Oracle, VB, Excel and Hyperion. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to start collaborate early on with people who have complementary skill sets and interests, as I am a fearless serial
     entrepreneur, fast learner, and no stranger to feedback. 

- 📫 You can reach me here on Github @Michael-Roop.
